        We would like to express our deepest sympathies to all those affected
        by the new coronavirus infection.
      </div>
      We would like to express our sincere gratitude for your continued
      patronage of Uo no Tana Shopping Street.<br />
      Due to the spread of the new coronavirus infection, <br />a feeling of
      uncertain stagnation and fear of infection are constantly passing
      through my head.<br />
      I think everyone is having an uneasy day.<br />
      Even if it is a shopping street, this situation will improve as soon as
      possible,<br />
      I hope that peaceful days will come back.
