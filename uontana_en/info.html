      Due to the spread of the new coronavirus infection, <br />a feeling of

      I think everyone is having an uneasy day.<br />
      Even if it is a shopping street, this situation will improve as soon as
      possible,<br />
      I hope that peaceful days will come back.

The fruit and vegetable shop also sells lemons and ginger necessary for making simmered nails.
