      We would like to express our sincere gratitude for your continued
      patronage of Uo no Tana Shopping Street.<br />
      Due to the spread of the new coronavirus infection, <br />a feeling of
      uncertain stagnation and fear of infection are constantly passing
      through my head.<br />
      I think everyone is having an uneasy day.<br />
      Even if it is a shopping street, this situation will improve as soon as
      possible,<br />
      I hope that peaceful days will come back.

          </div>
          Harima Nada's "Ammodytes lanceolata fishing" will be lifted on Saturday, March 6th.
          At the fresh fish shop in the Uo no Tana shopping district, the annual "Ikanago Shinko" is sold. Fresh "Ammodytes lanceolata" freshly landed from the port every day is sent directly to the shopping district and lined up at the store. Please contact each store as the amount of arrival, arrival time, selling price, etc. on the day will differ from store to store. Shinko is cooked at each store as the spring taste of "nail simmered" or "kamaage" and is lined up in stores one after another, so please buy it. The fruit and vegetable shop also sells lemons and ginger necessary for making simmered nails.
          * Since Sunday is a closed fishing day, sand lance newborn fishing will not be held.
          * Depending on the weather and fishing conditions, it may not be available.        </td>
